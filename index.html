            Stranger Things
        </h1>
       <p>
     Stranger Things is set in 1980s Indiana, where a teen 
     with powerful psychic powers escapes a sinister government
     installation. Eleven joins forces with local nerds Mike,
     Dustin, Lucas and Will to battle demogorgons, the Mind
     Flayer and other monsters, including the chillingly 
     calculating Dr Brenner. Dr. Brenner is experimenting on
     test subject 010 until a mysterious incident kills all 
     of the subjects except Eleven. In 1986 — eight months
     after the events at Starcourt Mall — Joyce, Will,
    Jonathan, and Eleven have moved to a new house in
     Lenora Hills, California, where Eleven struggles
     with the loss of her powers and is bullied by other
      students at Lenora Hills High School. Joyce receives
    a porcelain doll in the mail, seemingly from Russia
      and finds a hidden note stating that Hopper is
     alive. In Hawkins, Mike and Dustin have joined 
     the high school's "Hellfire Club", a Dungeons & 
     Dragons club led by iconoclast Eddie Munson. As 
      a result, they miss seeing Lucas win the basketball
    team's championship game. Max, who has broken up 
     with Lucas, struggles to come to terms with Bill
     y's death. Chrissy Cunningham, a student on the 
     cheerleading team, is haunted by visions of her 
    abusive mother Laura Cunningham and a chiming 
     grandfather clock. While buying drugs from Eddie,
     Chrissy is possessed and killed by a sentient
     humanoid figure from her visions.
